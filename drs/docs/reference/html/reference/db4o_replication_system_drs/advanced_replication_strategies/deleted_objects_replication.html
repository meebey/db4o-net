        <h1>Deleted Objects Replication</h1>


<p>In addition to replicating changed/new objects, dRS is able to
replicate deletions of objects.&nbsp;When an object is deleted since last
replication in one database and you would like to replicate these
changes&nbsp;to another database you can use the following method to do this:</p>



<span class="cs"></p>
<p>c#:&nbsp;</p>

<p><code>replication .ReplicateDeletions(typeof(Car));</code></p>

<p></span>

<span class="vb"></p>
<p>VB:&nbsp;</p>

<p><code>replication .ReplicateDeletions(GetType(Car))</code></p>

<p></span>
</p>

<p>
dRS traverses every Car object in both providers. For instance, if a
deletion is found in one provider,&nbsp;the deletion will be replicated to
the other provider. During the traversal replication events will be
generated and can be used as usual. By default, in a case of a conflict the deletion
will prevail. You can choose the counterpart of&nbsp;the deleted object to
prevail using the event.</p>

<p>Note, that the deletions of a Parent will not be cascaded to child
objects. For example, if a Car contains a child object,&nbsp;e.g. Pilot,
Pilot will not be traversed and the deletions of Pilot will not be
replicated.<br></p>
