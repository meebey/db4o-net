		/// <br /><br />When objects are updated or deleted, the space previously occupied in the
		/// database file is marked as "free", so it can be reused. db4o maintains two lists
		/// in RAM, sorted by address and by size. Adjacent entries are merged. After a large
		/// number of updates or deletes have been executed, the lists can become large, causing
		/// RAM consumption and performance loss for maintenance. With this method you can
		/// specify an upper bound for the byte slot size to discard.
		/// <br /><br />Pass <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> to this method to discard all free slots for
		/// the best possible startup time.<br /><br />
		/// The downside of setting this value: Database files will necessarily grow faster.
		/// <br /><br />Default value:<br />
		/// <code>0</code> all space is reused
